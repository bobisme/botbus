## [0.31.3] - 2026-06-16

### Fixed

- `history -f` (follow mode) no longer drops messages. The follow cursor is now
  seeded from the initial bounded read's `next_offset` instead of the file's
  current EOF, and any startup backlog is drained before the event loop. With
  `--after-offset` plus a count limit, messages between the bounded read and EOF
  were previously skipped.
- `history --after-id <id> -n <count>` now reports a correct `next_offset`.
  Previously the result was truncated to `count` but `next_offset` pointed at
  EOF, so paginating with `--after-offset` skipped every message between the
  count-th returned message and EOF. `--after-id` now resolves to a byte offset
  and shares the lossless offset-based read path, and the pagination advice hint
  works for both `--after-offset` and `--after-id`.

## [0.31.2] - 2026-05-01

### Added

- `wait --from` conversation filter.

### Fixed

- Fresh-eyes bug sweep.
